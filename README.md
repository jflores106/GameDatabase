# Project Topic/Objective
A GUI-based Java application that connects to a video game database to insert tuples and run queries from a list. Video game database was populated with real data; missing attributes were randomly generated. Database is limited to games on xbox, playstation, and PC. With thousands of games released each year on various platforms, the main question most consumers have is whether a certain game will release on their preferred platform. Certain games are exclusive to a platform, a database helps keep track of exclusivity. Additionally, it helps keep track of the availability of a game among different countries as some games are banned in certain countries.
